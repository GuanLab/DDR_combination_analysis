# Mapping combinatorial drug effects to DNA damage response kinase inhibitors

Statistical analysis of DDR combination response high throughput screening dataset

## Overview

This repository contains code for statistical analysis of DDR targeted combination treatment response.

## Before you begin

Before running your code, please acquire the DDR combination response data from OSF repository: https://osf.io/8hbsx/
The molecular characteriation of all cell lines used in this study can be obtained at: https://osf.io/8mxgj/

## prerequites

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)(>=3.7.6)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)(>=1.18.1)
